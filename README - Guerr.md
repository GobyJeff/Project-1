# Project-1: The Marketablility of ZEVs in California

# Purpose
The purpose of our project is to maximize EV sales. We plan use the California Energy Commission recent ZEV Sales Data(2019-2023) to examine the marketability of each type of ZEV in each California County by analyzing the amount of sales and the preferred Make/Model per county . With this analysis, we can provide conclusions of how to market and boost ZEVs sales depending in their location. 

# Description

# Findings
The top ten counties for ZEV sales from 2019-2023 were Los Angeles,Orange,Santa Clara,San Diego,Alameda,Riverside,San Mateo,Contra Costa,San Bernardino,San Francisco & the bottom 5 were Trinity,Lassen,Alpine,Sierra,& Modoc,with the favorite make & model across all counties being the model 3 & model y. 

Edit, Guerr - 

1. Units sold to Median Incomes were plotted to bring a correlation factor of 0.3450 for 2019 and 0.2751 for 2020.

Question 1:
2. Series of highest median income units of evs sold per county filtered for being above the 75th percentile of accounted values was boxplotted and found the values for total units sold varied greatly above the third quartile.

3. Filtered for the top 3 counties in median income and compared to the same table set of evs sold per county sitting above the 75th percentile of total accounted sales and saw that all three counties were in the upper quartile for both 2019 and 2020

4. Filtered the boxplot data of upper quartile filtered ev units sold outliers and Los Angeles held the number one spot for two consecutive years.

5. Looked at the comparison of total EV units sold and median incomes in both 2019 and 2020 just above the 3rd quartile of total ev units sold and obtained the range of median incomes to be between 35128 - 74077, and 69431 - 35438 respectively.

Question 2:
6. Series of the lowest units of evs sold (< 25%) per county were filtered this time to be boxplotted, and seen that the range of units of evs sold increase yoy 2019-2020.

7. Filtered the data of the bottom 25% of total accounted sales to match with the trailing counties in median income to find if the lowest median income counties matched any of the trailing ev sales counties. Trinity was found to be the only county in 2019, and that changed in 2020 to be Alpine. 

8. Analyzed each outlier for 2019 and 2019, and it changed from Lake Calaveras and Lake County to Amador County.

9. Looking at the comparison of total EV units sold and median incomes in both 2019 and 2020 below the 1st quartile of total ev units sold, and the range of median incomes were set to be between 31292 - 45101 in 2019, and 31360 - 44993 in 2020

10. The markup of EV to PHEV sales in the top high median income earning counties increased from 72% to 79% yoy (2019-20)

# Findings Analysis 
Edit, Guerr - 

1. We see that there is little to no correlation between median incomes and units sold per county, but do see that higher median incomes relate to more units sold as described by the scatter plot. 

Question 2:
2. The amount of sold evs did not differ greatly between the years 2019 and 2020

3. This shows that the counties with the highest median income will result in having a high record of ev units sold in California.

4. Los Angeles did not have exceptional ranking for median incomes for both years, yet held the higher number of ev units sold. There is a disparaity in the wealth gap possibly as median income only shows what half the population's income is in that county. Population may also be a big contributing factor as the reason why LA's median income is low compared to their higher earners.

5. This will be looked at again for further analysis

Question 2:
6. This seems to show the popularity of evs growing as the lowest percentile of sales increasing in range of sales as maybe the adoption of evs becoming more popular due to various reasons.

7. This result means that not all trailing median income counties will be found trailing in ev sales relative to the entire population of ev units sold.

8. Unsure what this tells us

9. Comparing the range of median incomes for the upper quartile and the lower quartile, we see that the upper quartile contains the most variance as there is a bigger range. the lower quartile range seems to have a low range of median income contributors to the least amount of ev sales.
This may suggest that counties with the least amount of ev units sold will only have counties with the least median incomes, but counties that have high ev units sold will have both low and high median incomes. Or No high median income earning counties will yield low ev unit sales.

10. Seems like the higher earning median income counties are progressively adopting evs and already have a lot of traction.

	- Project Description/Outline:
      description of scope of research: (Project Proposal)
   		Hypothesis: Tesla's are the most dominant ev manufacturer across California
      		Question 1: Why are the most evs sold in the top 3 counties? (Shows demand according to state/district)
	      		consumer preference to type of car: district scale to state scale
		    	consumer preference to model of car: district scale to state scale
		  	What are the top 3 models in the top 3 counties in  CA? (Shows how much an area is willing to pay for an ev)
   			Obtain the MSRP price points
   			Analyze across recent years (2019-2023)
   			illustrate total quantities sold for those 3 models
   			gas prices: Gas prices compared to ev sales/units
   			income level: find correlation between income levels and ev sales in these top 3 counties
   			infrastructure: comparison of nicer/developed roads/highways to ev units

   		Question 2: Why do the bottom 3 counties have the least amount of evs sold?
   			Look at income statistics
   		Question 3: What are the most popular ev types and why are they the most favorable?
