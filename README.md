# Project-1: The Marketablility of ZEVs in California

# Purpose
The purpose of our project is to maximize EV sales. We plan use the California Energy Commission recent ZEV Sales Data(2019-2023) to examine the marketability of each type of ZEV in each California County by analyzing the amount of sales and the preferred Make/Model per county . With this analysis, we can provide conclusions of how to market and boost ZEVs sales depending in their location. 
# Findings
The top ten counties for ZEV sales from 2019-2023 were Los Angeles,Orange,Santa Clara,San Diego,Alameda,Riverside,San Mateo,Contra Costa,San Bernardino,San Francisco & the bottom 5 were Trinity,Lassen,Alpine,Sierra,& Modoc,with the favorite make & model across all counties being the model 3 & model y. 

# Findings Analysis & Conclusion
In conclusion, the analysis of Electric Vehicles (EVs) in California reveals a clear pattern of higher adoption rates in certain counties and lower adoption rates in others. The top three counties for EV sales, namely Los Angeles, Orange County, and Santa Clara, stand out due to several key factors that drive their popularity. Firstly, their high population density and urban centers lead to increased demand for environmentally friendly transportation options. Secondly, the government's numerous and generous incentives for cleaner vehicles, coupled with substantial savings in fuel and maintenance costs, make EV ownership more financially attractive. Additionally, these counties boast an extensive and convenient charging infrastructure, providing consumers with peace of mind and confidence in making the switch to electric.

Conversely, the bottom three counties for EV sales, namely Alpin, Modoc, and Sierra, face unique challenges that hinder EV adoption. Limited charging infrastructure and a lower number of incentives offered in these regions discourage consumers from considering EVs as viable options. The rural geography of these counties poses difficulties in terms of accessibility and long distances between charging stations. Moreover, the perceived limitations of EVs, such as reduced towing and hauling capabilities compared to traditional vehicles, may dissuade consumers in these areas from making the transition to cleaner transportation.

Overall, the most popular EV types, all-electric vehicles (BEVs) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), have garnered significant popularity due to their multiple advantages. These advantages include environmental benefits, cost savings, supportive policies, advancements in battery technology, and positive public perception. As more people prioritize sustainability and governments continue to push for cleaner transportation, the demand for BEVs and PHEVs is expected to rise steadily, contributing to a greener and more sustainable future.

To encourage EV adoption in all counties, policymakers and stakeholders should work collaboratively to address the specific challenges faced by each region. This can involve expanding charging infrastructure in less populated areas, providing targeted financial incentives, and conducting awareness campaigns to educate consumers about the benefits of EV ownership. By creating a conducive environment for EV adoption, California can lead the way in sustainable transportation and make significant strides towards reducing emissions and combating climate change.
