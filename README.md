# Project-1
Project Proposal
The purpose of our project is to maximize EV sales. We plan use the EV population census data to examine the marketability of each type of EV in each state, county, district, etc., by analyzing which is the most attractive attribute of the vehicle in certain locations . With this analysis, we can provide conclusions of how to market certain EVs depending in their location, and thus increasing EV sales.
