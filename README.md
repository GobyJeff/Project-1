# Project-1
Project Proposal
The purpose of our project is to maximize EV sales. We plan use the EV population census data to examine the marketability of each type of EV in each state, county, district, etc., by analyzing which is the most attractive attribute of the vehicle in certain locations . With this analysis, we can provide conclusions of how to market certain EVs depending in their location, and thus increasing EV sales.

	- Title: EV Marketability in the U.S.
	- Team Members: Alan, Adrian, Erick, Joy, Cristian
	- Project Description/Outline:
      description of scope of research: (Project Proposal)
	    Hypothesis: Tesla's are the most dominant ev manufacturer across the U.S. (2020)
		  Question 1: What is the Base MSRP per Capita? (Shows how much an area is willing to pay for an ev)
      Question 2: What is the production of EVs compared to state/district? (Shows what state/district are willing to supply to meet demand)
      Question 3: What are the quantities of type/model of car sold? (Shows demand according to state/district)
	      consumer preference to type of car: district scale to state scale
		    consumer preference to model of car: district scale to state scale
