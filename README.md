# Project-1
Project Proposal
The purpose of our project is to maximize EV sales. We plan use the EV population census data to examine the marketability of each type of EV in each state, county, district, etc., by analyzing which is the most attractive attribute of the vehicle in certain locations . With this analysis, we can provide conclusions of how to market certain EVs depending in their location, and thus increasing EV sales. 

Project Delegations:
- Final data analysis contains complete info in README file
- Final repository is professional
- at least 6 visualizations (2/question)
	- clear and accurate labeling
	- supported with ample and precise explanations
- Summarization of significant findings and implications
	- supported with numbers and visualizations
- Each question in project proposal is answered with precise descriptions and findings
	- supported with statistical analysis

To-Dos For next session: (may be edited as one sees fit and upon agreement with group members)
- come up with dataset(s) for analysis - complete
- Formulate project proposal - complete
	- Title: EV Marketability in the U.S.

	- Project Description/Outline:
      description of scope of research: (Project Proposal)
   		Hypothesis: Tesla's are the most dominant ev manufacturer across California
      		Question 1: What are the top 3 counties with the most evs sold? (Shows demand according to state/district)
	      		consumer preference to type of car: district scale to state scale
		    	consumer preference to model of car: district scale to state scale
		  	What are the top 3 models in the top 3 counties in  CA? (Shows how much an area is willing to pay for an ev)
   			Obtain the MSRP price points
   			Analyze across recent years (2019-2023)
   			illustrate total quantities sold for those 3 models
   		Question 2: Income statistics compared to evs?
   		Question 3: Worst 3 counties for evs vs diesel
   			Obtain worst performers for ev sales
   			analyze diesel sales
