# Project-1: The Marketablility of ZEVs in California

# Purpose
The purpose of our project is to maximize EV sales. We plan use the California Energy Commission recent ZEV Sales Data(2019-2023) to examine the marketability of each type of ZEV in each California County by analyzing the amount of sales and the preferred Make/Model per county . With this analysis, we can provide conclusions of how to market and boost ZEVs sales depending in their location. 

# Description

# Findings
The top ten counties for ZEV sales from 2019-2023 were Los Angeles,Orange,Santa Clara,San Diego,Alameda,Riverside,San Mateo,Contra Costa,San Bernardino,San Francisco & the bottom 5 were Trinity,Lassen,Alpine,Sierra,& Modoc,with the favorite make & model across all counties being the model 3 & model y.

	- Project Description/Outline:
      description of scope of research: (Project Proposal)
   		Hypothesis: Tesla's are the most dominant ev manufacturer across California
      		Question 1: Why are the most evs sold in the top 3 counties? (Shows demand according to state/district)
	      		consumer preference to type of car: district scale to state scale
		    	consumer preference to model of car: district scale to state scale
		  	What are the top 3 models in the top 3 counties in  CA? (Shows how much an area is willing to pay for an ev)
   			Obtain the MSRP price points
   			Analyze across recent years (2019-2023)
   			illustrate total quantities sold for those 3 models
   			gas prices: Gas prices compared to ev sales/units
   			income level: find correlation between income levels and ev sales in these top 3 counties
   			infrastructure: comparison of nicer/developed roads/highways to ev units

   		Question 2: Why do the bottom 3 counties have the least amount of evs sold?
   			Look at income statistics
   		Question 3: What are the most popular ev types and why are they the most favorable?
